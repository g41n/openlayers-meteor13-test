# openlayers-meteor13-test
Test repository to solve this issue (https://github.com/MasterAM/meteor-ol3/issues/6)

# Usage
Simply clone and run:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/g41n/openlayers-meteor13-test.git
$ cd openlayers-meteor13-test/
$ meteor run ios-device
```
Then choose to run on device or on iOS emulator (iPad 2 recommended).

I have the problem on iPad, so Mac is needed.
Still have to verify if the issue occur on Android too...
